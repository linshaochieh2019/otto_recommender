DTSA5510 Final Project

1 INTRODUCTION
Recommender system has been a widely studied topic - both in the academic and business field. Training recommender systems can be either a supervised learning or an unsupervised learning problem. In this project, I applied the unsupervised learning techniques that we learned in the course, such as cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity and KNN, to a real-world dataset. By presenting a model comparison analysis, this project revealed the limitations of the techniques when working with a huge dataset.
